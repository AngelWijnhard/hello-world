# hello-world
My first repository

Hi all.

My name is Ang√®l Wijnhard. 
I work for Capgemini in The Netherlands as a recruiter. 
Eventhough I'm in a differnt field, I'm interessted in learning how to code.
I start my first coding course in June. Because of that I started with an online course. 

Have a nice day!
